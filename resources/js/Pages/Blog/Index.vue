        I'm that guy who's always tinkering with ideas and making stuff. My projects are my metaphorical garden. <br><br>

        I'm currently working on a no-nonsense blogging platform and site builder and a character posing tool for artists. I keep a list of previous projects and work here. <br><br>

        I also write. Mostly short-to-mid length essays about tech, life, etc. At some point Iâ€™ll write a book. Maybe tomorrow.<br><br>
